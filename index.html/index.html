    <p class="Engineer">I am deeply inspired by the work and vision of Engineer Mohammad Ali Mirza Sahab. His dedication, hard work, and ability to apply knowledge in practical and meaningful ways have motivated me to improve my own life and career. His approach is not limited to technical expertise alone, but also reflects humanity, sincerity, and professionalism — making him a source of learning and inspiration for everyone.

Along with him, I am also greatly inspired by Dr. Israr Ahmed Sahab. His depth of knowledge, clarity of thought, and powerful explanations have helped me understand important aspects of life, deen, and society. His scholarly approach and devotion to spreading authentic knowledge continue to influence and guide me.

Both personalities have shaped my thinking and encouraged me to strive for personal, professional, and spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever takes a path upon which to obtain knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him.” 
Narrated Anas bin Malik: that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Who goes goes seeking knowledge, then he is in Allah's cause until he returns.”</p>
<p>Acquiring knowledge is a lifelong journey that shapes a person's character, wisdom, and understanding of the world. It opens the mind to new ideas, strengthens critical thinking, and empowers individuals to make better decisions. Knowledge is not gained only through books, but also through experience, observation, and learning from others. The more a person seeks knowledge, the more they grow in humility, because they realize how much more there is to learn. In every stage of life, the pursuit of knowledge lights the path toward personal growth, success, and a deeper appreciation of the world around us.</p>
<p>The Prophet ﷺ said:

“Whoever travels a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.
And the angels lower their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge.
Every creature in the heavens and on earth, even the fish in the water, seeks forgiveness for the scholar.

The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the moon over all the stars.
The scholars are the heirs of the prophets, and the prophets do not leave behind gold or silver;
they leave behind knowledge, so whoever takes it has taken a great share.”

This hadith shows the greatness of acquiring knowledge—how seekers are honored by Allah, helped by angels, and valued by all creation.Source: Jami‘ at-Tirmidhi (Hadith 2682)'</p>
